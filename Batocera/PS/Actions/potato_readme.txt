These actions are intended to be used with a pair of day and night images, acquired as GPU screen shots while running the Mega Bezel, 
along with a third shot using the BW screen mask and black screen in the Render For Simplified Presets parameter group.

There are two actions. After selecting the BW mask and copying it to the clip board, focus on a day graphic. Ctrl+Shift+F11 will apply the mask to the image.

Shift + drag and drop the night image onto the day image (Shift will guarentee in is centered.) Ctrl+Shift+F12 will apply 
the mask to the night image, reorder the layers and rename the respective layers to "day" and "night". It will leave the night layer selected.

If you would like a screen inner shadow, leave the night layer selected and apply the Potato_shadow style to the layer.

The shadow is intended for a 4K image. If you are using a 1080 image you can change the spread to 10 and the size to 12
or use the Inner_shadow style on a prepared layer. (Details are in the style folder)
